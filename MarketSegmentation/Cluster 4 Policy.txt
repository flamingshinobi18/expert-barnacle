<Introduction>
If you have a lot of money, you probably don't need credit for anything since you could pay cash for houses, cars, and other purchases. 
But rich people do borrow frequently, taking out loans such as mortgages and using credit cards. The difference is, most wealthy people 
follow a few simple rules when borrowing to help them ensure their loans improve their financial position -- rather than leaving them 
worse off while enriching their creditors.

<Debt consolidation>
Debt consolidation is when you take out a new loan to repay multiple loans, simplifying your repayment and potentially reducing the 
overall cost of your loan. While it's a helpful tool for some, only two types of debt can be consolidated: credit card, and 
high-interest personal loan debt.

<Line of credit> 
You can get a line of credit from your bank or credit union. You can even get secured credit, such as a home equity line of credit 

<Credit-builder loans>
Credit-builder loans are small, short-term loans that are taken out to help you build credit. Instead of receiving the loan funds up 
front as you would on a traditional loan, you make fixed monthly payments and receive the money back at the end of the loan term. 
Credit-builder loans typically range between $300 to $3,000 and charge annual percentage rates (APRs) between 6% and 16%.

<Umbrella Insurance>
Umbrella insurance is an extra type of insurance policy that people can buy on top of other protection, such as auto insurance and 
homeowners insurance. Specifically, it provides added liability insurance protection that goes above and beyond the limits on existing 
coverage. For example, say a driver had a car insurance policy that included $100,000 of liability coverage. If the driver got into an 
accident and caused $200,000 in damage, the auto insurance would pay the first $100,000 in losses to victims and umbrella insurance 
would cover the difference.
